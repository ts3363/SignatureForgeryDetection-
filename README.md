# 🖋️ Signature Forgery Detection using Deep Learning

This project focuses on detecting forged signatures using deep learning techniques implemented in a Jupyter Notebook. It applies image preprocessing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to classify whether a signature is **genuine** or **forged**.

## 📂 Dataset

The model can be trained on signature datasets like:
- [CEDAR Signature Dataset](http://www.iapr-tc11.org/mediawiki/index.php/CEDAR_Forgery_Database)
- Any other dataset containing paired `genuine` and `forged` signature images.
